/**
 * @file
 * Drupal site-specific configuration file.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * This file may have been set to read-only by the Drupal installation program.
 * If you make changes to this file, be sure to protect it again after making
 * your modifications. Failure to remove write permissions to this file is a
 * security risk.
 *
 * In order to use the selection rules below the multisite aliasing file named
 * sites/sites.php must be present. Its optional settings will be loaded, and
 * the aliases in the array $sites will override the default directory rules
 * below. See sites/example.sites.php for more information about aliases.
 *
 * The configuration directory will be discovered by stripping the website's
 * hostname from left to right and pathname from right to left. The first
 * configuration file found will be used and any others will be ignored. If no
 * other configuration file is found then the default configuration file at
 * 'sites/default' will be used.
 *
 * For example, for a fictitious site installed at
 * https://www.drupal.org:8080/my-site/test/, the 'settings.php' file is searched
 * for in the following directories:
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org.my-site.test
 * - sites/www.drupal.org.my-site.test
 * - sites/drupal.org.my-site.test
 * - sites/org.my-site.test
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org.my-site
 * - sites/www.drupal.org.my-site
 * - sites/drupal.org.my-site
 * - sites/org.my-site
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org
 * - sites/www.drupal.org
 * - sites/drupal.org
 * - sites/org
 *
 * - sites/default
 *
 * Note that if you are installing on a non-standard port number, prefix the
 * hostname with that number. For example,
 * https://www.drupal.org:8080/my-site/test/ could be loaded from
 * sites/8080.www.drupal.org.my-site.test/.
 *
 * @see example.sites.php
 * @see \Drupal\Core\DrupalKernel::getSitePath()
 *
 * In addition to customizing application settings through variables in
 * settings.php, you can create a services.yml file in the same directory to
 * register custom, site-specific service definitions and/or swap out default
 * implementations with custom ones.

 * files. This could be either the same module that provides the stream wrapper
